Force is being pulled in from a ros node that is outputing LowState.msg from LowState.h in catkin_ws/devel/include.
You will never directly access LowState.h in the project file directory, it has to be generated by catkin_ws from instructions present in unitree_ros_to_real that links them

Force values should be coming in and parsed into individual legs in an array in ucf_go1_control_node.cpp, but only when use_sim is set to false, which is a internal manual change
It should be creating the same vector/array typing that the sim data is formatted as, so it should be fine to use the same control methods for both
For indexing the array for either dataset, it is array= [FL,FR,RL,RR]


The force values get propogated, used, or creates values used in the following structure:

		                         jointTraj -> pub_traj -> ROS Node/Robot Command msg(trajectory_msgs::JointTrajectory)
						            ^
						            |
Everywhere forces get used: getJointTrajectory <- footPosVel -> position/velocity -> joint_positions,jacobians,etc -> F_leg -> jointTorques
									                  ^
									                  |
								                   getFoot <- footPhase_ -> legPhase ->phaseIdx <-> pose.pose
											                      ^
											                      |
                                                            phaseStateMachine <- only to a print statement, 
                                                            but this has all the gait phase controls, so probably really needed but never implemented

Force was never explictly used in any file, but they exist in the ones that forces would have some effect on the output command.

    Force needs to added to: phaseStateMachine primarily from what i can see is what really needs it added, I'm currently unsure of where else might need it.


Also, using footForceEst because it supposedly outputs the force value as an estimated force in Newtons, so we don't have to calibrate the sensors or deal with raw data
